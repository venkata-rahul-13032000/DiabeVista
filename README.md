# DiabeVista
## Unraveling Intelligent Diabetes Insights through Advanced Data Analysis and Visualization

The global diabetes epidemic has underscored shortcomings in conventional healthcare strategies, which struggle to
adapt to diverse patient responses, evolving drug formulations, and the complexities of coexisting conditions. Current
approaches lack detailed prediction capabilities and fail to deliver personalized interventions. Addressing this gap
requires a shift towards sophisticated, data-driven healthcare solutions. A comprehensive solution is needed to leverage
advanced data analysis and visualization, enabling care for individuals with diabetes, surpassing traditional methods.

The prevalence of diabetes worldwide has highlighted the limitations of conventional healthcare approaches, which face
challenges in accommodating the varying responses of patients, the ever-changing formulations of drugs, and the
intricacies of coexisting medical conditions. The existing methods lack precise predictive abilities and fall short in
providing tailored interventions. To bridge this gap, a transition towards advanced, data-oriented healthcare solutions is
imperative. A holistic approach is necessary to harness the power of advanced data analysis and visualization, facilitating
individualized care for diabetes patients that surpasses the capabilities of traditional methods.

### Extensive Dataset Description:
The dataset for this project is sourced from the University of California, Irvine's Machine Learning Repository, covering
ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care data from 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. Each entry
represents hospital records of diabetes-diagnosed patients, including demographics, medical history, admission details,
lab results, medications, and prior healthcare encounters. Another dataset initially used for mock modeling contains the
signs and symptoms data of newly diabetic or would-be diabetic patients. This has been collected using direct
questionnaires from the patients of Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh, and approved by a doctor.

### Patient Data Quantity:
The dataset contains 101,766 cases, each corresponding to a distinct hospital visit of a patient with diabetes. These cases
encompass a wide array of patient characteristics, health conditions, treatment plans, and hospital results. Featuring 47
attributes of categorical and numerical nature, the dataset presents a thorough examination of different elements that
impact the management of diabetes and the likelihood of patient readmission. The other dataset contains 521 cases each
corresponding to a newly diabetic patient each featuring a total of 15 attributes that vary from age, gender, etc. of patient
also include alarming levels of certain vitals that are generally observed in a diabetic person.

### Interactive Dashboard Requirements:

To develop an interactive dashboard for analyzing datasets, we will combine information from the University of
California, Irvine's Machine Learning Repository, preprocess it, and structure it for visual representation. By utilizing
Streamlit, a Python framework recognized for its user friendly nature, we will build the dashboard featuring tabs for
easy navigation and live data visualization. These tabs will encompass Data Exploration, Feature Extraction, Model
Details, and Patient Readmission, providing tools for visualizations, model training, performance metrics, and predictive
analysis. The machine learning models trained on the dataset will deliver instant predictions and valuable insights into the risks associated with patient readmission.

**Dashboard Layout:** The dashboard was designed with a tab-based navigation system using Streamlit. Each tab is
dedicated to a specific component of the data analysis and machine learning pipeline, such as Data Exploration, Feature
Extraction, Model Details, and Patient Readmission.\
**Data Visualization Methods:** By employing a variety of visualization techniques like heatmaps, bar charts, line plots,
and histograms, we aim to effectively communicate insights and analysis findings. These visualizations are thoughtfully
selected to aid in understanding the dataset, features, model performance, and patterns related to patient readmission.\
**Feature Engineering:** Within the Feature Extraction section, we have incorporated feature engineering methods such
as SelectKBest, VarianceThreshold, and one-hot encoding to preprocess and extract pertinent features from the dataset.
This thorough approach ensures that the models are trained on meaningful and informative input features, thereby
improving their predictive capabilities.

### Development Methods, Tools, and Technologies:
**Programming Language:** The Python programming language was utilized to implement the solution, taking advantage
of its extensive collection of libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Notably, pandas, scikit-
learn, and matplotlib were leveraged for these purposes.\
**Dashboard Framework:** To construct the interactive dashboard, Streamlit was chosen as the primary framework. Its
user-friendly nature and simplicity enable the swift development of data-driven web applications directly from scripts.\

interventions. Collaboration with healthcare institutions and research organizations offers further potential for growth.

### Conclusion:

In conclusion, the DiabeVista project utilizes data-driven approaches to tackle diabetes management and patient
readmission prediction. Through in-depth analysis of a ten-year clinical dataset, we've developed predictive models and
an interactive dashboard offering insights into patient demographics, treatment outcomes, and readmission risks. By
leveraging machine learning and visualization techniques, we aim to empower healthcare professionals with tools for
informed decisions and personalized care. As we refine and expand, we envision data-driven interventions central to
improving patient outcomes and reducing diabetes-related complications.
